# weathernow

This is the code for my home weatherstation project.

It was designed to be run on two ESP32 boards.

The code in base station was designed for a DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT board connected to a Nextion display.

The code in sensor_bme_wind_rain was designed for a LOLIN WEMOS32 board connected to a BME280 over I2C and a Sparkfun weather sensor setup.
